WHAT IS SEE?  

Led by NASA, the Simulation Exploration Experience (SEE) joins students, industry, associations, and faculty in breaking down barriers to employability, building career confidence and capability. The experience creates collaborative college-level modeling and simulation learning as highly-dispersed inter-university teams design, develop, test and execute a simulated lunar mission.
